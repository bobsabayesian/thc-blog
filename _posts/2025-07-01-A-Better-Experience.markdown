You don’t need to know all the science to feel the difference.

This edible is designed to be **very** light — just enough to help your body relax and your mind slow down, without feeling “high” or out of control. Many people who are cautious about cannabis find this combination to be their favorite starting point.

## The First Hour: Nothing Loud

After you eat the edible, not much happens at first. That’s okay — this is slow, by design. You might just notice that your shoulders start to feel a little less tense. Breathing may come a little easier. The world is still the same, but it feels like it’s holding you more gently.

## Hour Two: A Calm Glow

This is when the calm starts to settle in. You’re not “buzzed.” You’re not foggy. Just… *okay*. Thoughts are still there, but they’re quieter. Your body feels a little looser, especially if you were carrying discomfort or stress earlier in the day. Some people say it feels like the volume knob on their nervous system has been turned down a few notches.

You can still do normal things — go for a walk, have a conversation, watch a show — you just might enjoy them more, because you’re not bracing against anything.

## Hour Four and Beyond: A Gentle Fade

As the hours pass, the effects start to fade, slowly and softly. There’s no crash. Just a return to your regular state, but often with a bit more softness. Some people notice they sleep better afterward. Others feel clearer the next day. It’s subtle — but that’s part of what makes it feel safe.

> “I don’t want to feel high, I just want to feel better.”  
> “I’m curious, but I don’t want to lose control.”  
> “I’ve had a bad experience before, and I want to take it slow.”

If any of these sound like you, this kind of edible may be a good place to start.  
It won’t change who you are. It just makes a little more space to be at ease.
