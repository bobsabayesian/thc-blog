description: "Reframing how we talk about marijuana by grounding it in benefits, not jargon."

For too long, we’ve thought about the experience of marijuana in ways that failed to communicate its benefits clearly to the user.

We relied on esoteric knowledge of strains and clones—language that often obscured what could be a simple, well-qualified experience.

I remember feeling hesitant when I first got into wine. It seemed so impenetrable, filled with jargon and unspoken rules. I imagine the average person stepping into a dispensary for the first time feels the same kind of dread. And if that’s true, how many potential recreational users have walked away before they ever got to try the product—simply because they didn’t know where to begin?

Worse, how many potential medical patients have passed on cannabis—and all of its possible benefits—because they couldn’t make sense of terms like *sativa* and *indica*?

It doesn’t need to be this hard.

We now know the relative quantities of THC, CBD, CBN, and CBG in most products. We understand how different methods of ingestion affect how these compounds are absorbed, how long they take to kick in, and how long they last. We even know which parts of the brain these chemicals act on, and how they interact to shape how a high feels—moment to moment.

With this knowledge, we can construct simple visuals that show how key benefits rise and fall over the course of the experience. That alone makes cannabis more approachable. But we can go further.

I’ve trained a language model to speak with users in a web app I’ll launch later this year. It can help people explore what to expect from a given product, and guide them as they reflect on how it made them feel. Alongside it, I’ve developed stub articles and sample graphs to demonstrate how powerful it is to describe the cannabis experience clearly—so that users can make better decisions, feel more in control, and enjoy the experience more fully.

Throughout this blog, I’ll refer to a handful of **key benefits**. When I mention them, here’s what I mean:

## Key Benefits

- **Euphoria**  
  A lifted emotional state—joy, lightness, or a gentle buzz that makes everything feel just a bit better.

- **Calm**  
  A grounded feeling of peace, stillness, and emotional ease. Less mental noise. Less urgency.

- **Pain Relief**  
  A reduction in physical discomfort or tension, sometimes subtle and sometimes deeply soothing.

- **Clarity**  
  A clear-headed, present mental state—focused but flexible, alert but not anxious.
